# Viswaroop Vadlamudi — Personal Website

This repository contains the source for my personal website and blog, built with **Jekyll**.

Live site: https://vviswaroop.github.io

## Quick start 🔧

Prerequisites: Ruby and Bundler installed.

Run the site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run the dev server
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Open http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

## Writing posts ✍️

- Add a Markdown file to `_posts/` using the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Include front matter with at least `title:` and `date:`. `tags:` is optional.
- Posts use the `post` layout by default.

## Content & pages 💡

- Key site pages: `about`, `blog`, and topic pages like `/developer/`, `/product/`, and `/infrastructure/`.
- Top tags are generated by `scripts/generate_top_tags.rb` into `_data/top_tags.yml` and used by the homepage.
