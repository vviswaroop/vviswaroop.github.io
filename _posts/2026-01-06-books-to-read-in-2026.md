<p class="lead">This is my 2026 reading plan: focused, practical, and tied to problems I want to solve this year.</p>

## The list

**The Psychology of Money — Morgan Housel**  
Behavioral finance and decision-making under uncertainty. I want the mental models, not just the numbers.

**Principles — Ray Dalio**  
I want a clearer system for decision hygiene, especially around hiring, feedback, and operating cadence.

**Designing Data-Intensive Applications — Martin Kleppmann**  
Re-read for depth. I want to revisit consistency trade-offs and operational lessons as system scale grows.

**The Staff Engineer's Path — Tanya Reilly**  
Focus on technical leadership without management. I want to sharpen how I influence across teams.

**The Art of War — Sun Tzu**  
Strategy, clarity, and composure under pressure. Useful framing for incident response and planning.

**The Let Them Theory — Mel Robbins**  
Letting go of control to reduce friction and improve collaboration. I'm curious how it applies to teams.

**System Design Interview, Part 2 — Alex Xu**  
Practice on deeper distributed systems patterns and trade-offs.

**Software Engineering at Google — Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, Hyrum Wright**  
For long-lived codebases and engineering culture at scale.

## Why this list

- Build stronger decision frameworks.
- Improve strategic thinking and calm under pressure.
- Go deeper on system design and long-term maintainability.
