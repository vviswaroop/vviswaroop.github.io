<p class="lead">I tracked reading differently this year: fewer highlights, more application. These are the books that stuck — and the one idea I kept from each.</p>

## Grit & mindset

**Can’t Hurt Me — David Goggins**  
The “accountability mirror” and daily “callus the mind” reps translated into a weekly cadence: pick one hard thing, do it, write the outcome. It kept discipline from being abstract.

**Never Finished — David Goggins**  
“Take souls” became a frame for stressful weeks: turn friction into fuel and look for one extra rep when things feel stuck. I used it for long incidents and late-stage projects.

## Ownership & leadership

**Extreme Ownership — Jocko Willink & Leif Babin**  
Defaulting to “it’s on me” made incident reviews sharper. The brief–execute–debrief loop cut blame and increased clarity on what to fix next.

## Parenting

**The Montessori Baby — Simone Davies, Junnifa Uzodike**  
“Follow the child” and prepared environments led to fewer toys and more floor time. I set up low shelves and rotated materials weekly; engagement went up and overstimulation dropped.

## Wealth, leverage, and focus

**Rich Dad Poor Dad — Robert Kiyosaki**  
The simple assets-vs-liabilities lens made me audit spending and treat skills as assets. I redirected “maybe” purchases into a small investing autopilot.

**The Almanack of Naval Ravikant — Eric Jorgenson**  
Specific knowledge + leverage + ownership stayed on my desk. I applied it by picking one leverage point per quarter (automation, writing, or teaching) instead of chasing every idea.

## What changed because of these books

- Weekly “accountability mirror” notes turned into a reliable discipline loop.
- Incident reviews now start with ownership, then actions; they finish faster and with clearer fixes.
- Montessori setup at home reduced clutter and made play time calmer and more focused.
- Spending and time both get the assets/liabilities test; more energy goes to leverage, less to noise.
